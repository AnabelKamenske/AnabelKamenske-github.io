                Hello! My name is Anabel Kamenske. I was born in Illlinois and I moved to Wisconsin when I was about 3 years old.
                I live not too far from Appleton and I am currently going for my degree in Software Development. In my free time, I like to spend time with friends
                and do a lots of crafts. I own my own small custom 3D printing buisness called Bellie's Craft Creations.
            </p>
